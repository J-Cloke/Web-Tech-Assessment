    <aside class="aside-1">The culture of Spain is influenced by its Western origin, its interaction with other 
        cultures in Europe, its historically Catholic religious tradition and the varied national and regional 
        identities within the country.<br><br> It encompasses literature, music, visual arts, cuisine as well as contemporary 
        customs, beliefs, institutions and social norms. <br>
            <br>A significant portion of Spanish cuisine derives from the Roman tradition. 
            <br><br>
            The Moorish people were a strong influence in part of Spain for many centuries. 
            However, pork is popular and for centuries eating pork was also a statement of Christian ethnicity or "cleanliness 
            of blood", because it was not eaten by Jews or Muslims.
            <br><br>
            Several ingredients from the Americas were introduced to Europe through Spain during the so-called Columbian 
            exchange, and a modern Spanish cook could not do without potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, and beans. 
            These are some of the primary influences that have differentiated Spanish cuisine from Mediterranean cuisine.
