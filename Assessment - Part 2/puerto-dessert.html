            <aside class="aside-3">If you've never had maduros, you're in for a treat! These sweet plantain bites are 
                creamy and tender in the middle, while also being crisp on the outer edges, and can be served as a 
                snack or side dish to the main course.

                If you are new to plantains, you may often confuse them with bananas. Both plantains and bananas 
                originate from Southeast Asia and are a part of the genus Musa, but key differences in flavor and 
                usage set them apart.
                <br><br>
                Plantains are thicker and much larger in size than the “typical” bananas we know. They are also 
                much more starchy, and not very sweet. Although they are fruit, plantains are not often consumed raw. 
                They are more similar to vegetables in terms of how they are used, and are usually boiled, fried, or 
                baked.

            <h3>METHOD</h3>
            <p>1. Cut both ends off the plantains. Using a knife, score the skin lengthwise on two sides. Then, 
                slowly peel the skin off the plantains. Plantains don't peel like bananas, so these instructions are 
                important and will help you easily get the skin off.</p>
            <p>2. Cut the plantain flesh into slices on the diagonal. </p>
            <p>3. In a large pan, heat about ¼ inch of oil on medium-high heat. Heat until the oil is very hot. 
                Test this by flicking a little water into the oil. If it pops and sizzles then your oil is ready.</p>
            <p>4. In batches, add the plantains to the oil. (I did about 6 slices at a time) It's important to do this 
                in batches so you don't make the oil temperature drop too much.</p>
            <p>5. Fry the plantains for about 2-4 minutes on each side. They are done when they are a little bit 
                browned and look kind of caramelized.</p>
            <p>6. Remove plantains from the pan and place them on a plate lined with a paper towel. This is done to 
                drain off any excess oil.</p>
            <p>7. Serve and eat!</p>
