    <aside class="aside-1">The culture of Japan has changed greatly over the millennia, 
        from the country's prehistoric J≈çmon period, to its contemporary modern culture, 
        which absorbs influences from Asia.
        <br><br> 
        Japanese culture was influenced from ancient times to the 
        Middle Ages primarily by multiple Chinese dynasties, with substantial derivation from the Tang Dynasty, 
        and to a lesser extent by other Asian countries. For example, one of the scripts for writing in the 
        Japanese language is Chinese characters (kanji), but Japanese have no genetic relationship with Chinese. 
        Since the Meiji era Japan has been primarily influenced by western countries.
        <br><br>
        Through a long culinary 
        past, the Japanese have developed sophisticated and refined cuisine. 
        In more recent years, Japanese food has become fashionable and popular in the United States, 
        Europe, and many other areas.
        <br><br>
        Dishes such as sushi, tempura, noodles, and teriyaki are some of the 
        foods that are commonly known. The Japanese diet consists principally of rice; fresh, lean seafood; 
        and pickled or boiled vegetables. The Japanese diet is often believed to be related to the longevity of 
        Japanese people.
