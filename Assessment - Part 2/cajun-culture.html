            <aside class="aside-1">The Cajuns (/ˈkeɪdʒənz/; French: les Cadjins or les Cadiens, also known as 
                Louisiana Acadians (French: les Acadiens), are a Louisiana French ethnicity mainly found in the 
                U.S. state of Louisiana.
                <br><br>
                While Cajuns are usually described as the descendants of the Acadian exiles who 
                went to Louisiana over the course of Le Grand Dérangement, Louisianians frequently use Cajun as a broad 
                cultural term (particularly when referencing Acadiana) without necessitating descent from the deported Acadians.
                <br><br>
                Cajun cuisine focused on local ingredients and wild game (e.g., duck, rabbit), vegetables 
                (e.g., okra, mirlitons), and grains. Coastal communities relied heavily on fish and shellfish. 
                Seafood, especially shellfish, is still very popular in the region and remains a dominant feature of 
                many classic Cajun dishes like seafood gumbo and court-bouillon.
                <br><br>
                Since many Cajuns were farmers and not especially wealthy, they were known for not wasting any part 
                of a butchered animal. Many rural communities held a weekly boucherie, which is a communal 
                butchering of an animal, often a pig. Each family received a share of the meat. 
                Some high-profile foods like grattons and boudin are examples of Cajun cuisine that are widely popular.
