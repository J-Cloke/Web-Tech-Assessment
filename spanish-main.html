            <aside class="aside-3">In Basque language, marmitako means what it is inside the pot. So when the 
                Basque fishermen were cooking aboard their boats… What did they have inside their cooking pots? 
                They had potatoes and tuna. They had marmitako.
                <br><br>
                The marmitako is a traditional pot dish original from the Basque Country. It was the Basque 
                fishermen — also known as the arrantzaleak — who first came up with this recipe, although it got 
                quickly spread around other regions from the northern coast of Spain such as Cantabria and Asturias.

        <aside class="aside-5"><h2>Instructions</h2>
            <h3>METHOD</h3>
            <p>1. First of all we need to hydrate the choricero peppers. To do this, just put them in a bowl and cover 
                them with warm water. Leave them for at least 30 minutes (even better if you leave them for a couple 
                of hours). Once they are ready, scratch the pulp and discard the skin.</p>
            <h3>Making the fish stock:</h3>
            <p>1. Before you start, make sure the fish bones are clean. If they are not, you should blanch them in 
                order to remove any potential dirt.</p>
            <p>2. To do the stock put all the ingredients in a pot and add enough water to cover them. Bring to boil and 
                then turn the heat down to medium. Cook for 25 minutes, making sure you keep defoaming the broth. 
                Sieve the stock and reserve aside.</p>
            <h3>Making the marmitako:</h3>
            <p>1. Heat some olive oil in a casserole and gently fry the peppers, the garlic and the onion until the 
                latter becomes transparent but not brown. Just before the onion becomes transparent, add the bread 
                crust in order to toast it slightly.</p>
            <p>2. Peel the potatoes and break them into large pieces inside the casserole. It is very important to break 
                them rather than cut them so that the potatoes starch gets released and the sauce thickens. 
                Cook for 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
            <p>3. Add the tomato sauce, the choricero peppers pulp, the cayenne flakes, the sweet pimenton and the 
                white wine. Stir in everything and then pour enough fish stock to just cover the ingredients. 
                Season to taste and cook for 35 to 40 minutes over a medium heat.</p>
            <p>4. 10 minutes before it's done, dice the bonito into 4 cm cubes and seal it in a frypan or a skillet with 
                some olive oil until the fish cubes get golden on the outside. Then take the casserole off the heat 
                and add the bonito so that it cooks with the residual heat.</p>
            <p>5. Taste it, adjust the seasoning if necessary and add some finely chopped fresh parsley on top. Serve 
                immediately.</p>
            <p><br>Getting the size of the bonito cubes right is key to achieve a successful marmitako. The bigger they 
                are, the juicier the fish will be, so make sure you calculate pieces that can be eaten in a couple of 
                bites rather than just one.</p>
