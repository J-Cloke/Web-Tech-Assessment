            <aside class="aside-3">If you love pork, you must try this kakuni (角煮, simmered pork belly). The pork 
                is cooked slowly so it is tender and it has a lovely sweet soy sauce flavour, but it does not over 
                power the flavour of pork. Though it requires patience to cook slowly, this is very easy to make. 
                <br><br>
                Some say that kakuni came from China during the time when Japan was closed to most of the outside 
                world. At the time, the only port city where foreign ships had access to was Nagasaki and the 
                Chinese dish called Dongpo Pork was introduced to Nagasaki. Over the years, it was modified to the 
                Japanese palette and evolved to became kakuni.
                <br><br>
                Pork belly has a lot of fat but that's where all the flavour is. However, by cooking the pork belly 
                for a long time, much of the fat melts away and the fat that remains is really tender so the 
                finished dish does not taste fatty.

            <h3>METHOD</h3>
            <p>1. Place oil in a large heavy-based saucepan over high heat. Sear pork, turning, for 5-6 minutes until 
                all sides are lightly golden and skin is slightly blistered.</p>
            <p>2. Combine sake, soy, mirin, sugar, ginger and 4 cups (1L) water in a large jug. Pour over pork 
                belly and bring to a simmer. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface. Reduce heat to low, 
                cover with a lid and simmer for 1 hour 15 minutes-1 hour 30 minutes, until pork is tender, but not 
                falling apart. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Chill overnight to allow flavours to 
                develop.</p>
            <p>3. Meanwhile, bring a small saucepan of water to the boil. Add eggs and cook for 6 1/2 minutes. 
                Drain and refresh in iced water. Peel eggs and place in cooking liquid with the pork to marinate 
                overnight.</p>
            <p>4. The following day, remove eggs and set aside. Place pan over medium heat and bring to a gentle 
                simmer. Simmer for 20-25 minutes until pork is warmed through. Remove pork from braising liquid and 
                thinly slice. Place on a serving platter and pour over braising liquid. Top with halved eggs. To eat, 
                place a slice of pork on a lettuce leaf and top with desired condiments and egg, and 
                roll up to eat.</p>
